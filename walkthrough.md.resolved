# All in One AI - Walkthrough

I have built the "All in One AI" application using **FastAPI** for the backend and **HTML/CSS/JS** for the frontend, with a modern, glassmorphism design.

## Features Implemented

1.  **Login Page**: A sleek entry point (Authentication is mocked for prototype).
2.  **Home Page**: Clear selection between **Paid** and **Free** (Unpaid) tools.
3.  **Subcategories (NEW)**: Filter tools by category (e.g., Writing, Coding, PDF).
4.  **Tools List**: Display tools with descriptions and icons.
5.  **AI Tools Database**: Comprehensive JSON database with 40+ tools.

## Demo Flow

### 2. Subcategories Selection
After selecting a type (e.g., Free), users see available categories.
- Writing & Grammar
- Coding Help
- PDF Help
- ...and more.

### 3. Tools List
Clicking a category shows the specific tools.
- **Top Paid Tools**: ChatGPT Plus, Midjourney, Adobe Firefly...
- **Top Free Tools**: Bing Image Creator, ChatPDF, Replit...

## How to Run

The server is currently running in the background.

If you need to restart it:
```powershell
python -m uvicorn main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 --reload
```

## Next Steps
- Implement search across all tools.
- Add user ratings or reviews.
